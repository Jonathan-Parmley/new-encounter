# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


#  Pending for now seeding 
#  because of error message: ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: User must exist
#  We don't have User in db (rails c User.all = empty array)


# puts "Cleaning database..."
# Experience.destroy_all
# puts 'database is clean'

# Experience.create!(
#     title: "Yoga for Beginner",
#     description: "Yoga is an ancient healing wellness,assisted yoga postures, breathing and meditation to bring the body into a state of deep relaxation. Let's get start wit me!",
#     location: "Berlin, Mitte",
